## 📖 Overview

JMSR allows you to cast media from any Jellyfin client (web, mobile, TV) to your desktop, where it plays in MPV with full support for your custom configurations, shaders, and scripts.

> **💡 Key Philosophy**
>
> JMSR does **NOT** embed `libmpv`. Instead, it spawns and controls a standalone MPV process via JSON IPC. This preserves your existing `mpv.conf`, shader packs (Anime4K, FSR, etc.), and all local customizations without compromise.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 📺 **Cast Target** | Appears as a controllable device in Jellyfin's cast menu |
| 🚀 **External MPV** | Full compatibility with your system MPV configuration and shaders |
| 🔒 **Persistent Auth** | Login once, stay connected with secure token storage |
| 🔑 **Quick Connect** | Authenticate with Jellyfin by approving a one-time code on another device |
| 🔄 **Auto-Reconnect** | Resilient WebSocket connection with exponential backoff strategy |
| ⏭️ **Smart Playback** | Automatically plays the next episode when the current one finishes |
| ✂️ **Intro Skipper** | Automatically skips Intro Skipper plugin introduction and credit ranges |
| 🧠 **Series Memory** | Remembers audio/subtitle language preferences per TV series |
| ⌨️ **Shortcuts** | Use `Shift+N` / `Shift+P` directly in MPV to skip episodes |
| 🖥️ **System Tray** | Runs quietly in the background with quick access controls |
| 🛡️ **Type-Safe** | 100% type-safe Rust-to-TypeScript communication via `tauri-specta` |
| 🍏 **Cross-Platform** | Native support for Windows, macOS, and Linux |

## 📦 Release Notes

### v1.3.2

- Migrated login, diagnostics, settings, subtitle priorities, session dialog, and now playing controls to headless Ark UI Solid primitives while preserving JMSR Control Room styling and behavior.
### v1.3.1

- Added Arch Linux `.pkg.tar.zst` release packaging.

### v1.3.0

- Added Intro Skipper plugin support for automatic introduction and credit skips.
- Added a global Automation toggle to enable or disable Intro Skipper behavior.
- Added once-per-session skip semantics so manual seeks back into skipped ranges are respected.
- Added verification coverage for plugin failures, malformed ranges, disabled behavior, progress reporting, and existing track controls.

## 🏗️ Architecture

JMSR utilizes a robust three-actor architecture to ensure stability and separation of concerns.

    style D fill:#aa5cc3,stroke:#333,color:white
```

1.  **Sentinel (Tauri GUI)**: Handles UI, WebSocket connection to Jellyfin, and state management.
2.  **Bridge (Rust IPC)**: Translates commands and manages the external process.
3.  **Player (MPV)**: The standalone media player instance running your config.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

*   [MPV](https://mpv.io/) installed and in PATH

### Installation

#### Download Pre-built Binaries (Recommended)

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/hewel/jmsr/releases):

| Platform | Download |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Windows** | `.msi` (installer) or `.exe` (NSIS) |
| **macOS** | `.dmg` |
| **Linux** | `.deb`, `.AppImage`, or Arch Linux `.pkg.tar.zst` |

Install the Arch Linux package from a release asset with:

```bash
sudo pacman -U jmsr-<version>-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
```

#### Build from Source

<details>
<summary>Development prerequisites</summary>

*   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (or npm/yarn)
*   [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
*   Tauri CLI: `bun add -g @tauri-apps/cli`

</details>

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hewel/jmsr.git
cd jmsr

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build production binaries
bunx tauri build
```

Binaries will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

### Usage Steps

1.  **Launch JMSR** from your application menu or terminal.
2.  **Authenticate** with Quick Connect or by entering your Jellyfin server URL and credentials.
3.  **Cast Media**: JMSR will appear as "JMSR" in your Jellyfin client's cast menu.
4.  **Optional Intro Skipper**: Install the Jellyfin Intro Skipper plugin and keep Operations Console > Automation > Automatic Intro Skip enabled to skip detected intros and credits.
5.  **Enjoy**: Media plays in MPV on your desktop with full control syncing.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1.  **Authentication**: User logs into Jellyfin and receives an access token.
2.  **Registration**: JMSR posts capabilities to `/Sessions/Capabilities/Full`.
3.  **WebSocket**: Connects to Jellyfin for real-time play state control.
4.  **Cast Event**: When user casts, Jellyfin sends a `Play` command.
5.  **MPV Control**: JMSR spawns MPV (if needed) and sends JSON IPC commands.
6.  **Progress**: Event-driven progress reporting via MPV property observation.
7.  **Sync**: Pause/seek/volume commands flow bidirectionally (Jellyfin ↔ MPV).
8.  **Auto-Play**: Automatically fetches the next episode upon natural file end.

### Commands

| Task | Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend Dev** | `bun run dev` |
| **Tauri Dev** | `bunx tauri dev` |
| **Build Prod** | `bunx tauri build` |
| **Test** | `bun run test` |
| **Lint/Format** | `bun run check` |

### 📏 Code Conventions

*   **TypeScript**: Single quotes, Biome formatting.
*   **Rust**: 2-space indent (standard `rustfmt.toml`).
*   **IPC**: Always use typed `commands.*` from bindings, never raw `invoke()`.
*   **Solid.js**: Use `createSignal`, `createResource` — **NOT** React hooks.

### ➕ Adding a Tauri Command

1.  **Add function** in `src-tauri/src/command.rs` with `#[tauri::command]` and `#[specta]`.
2.  **Register** in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` inside `collect_commands![]`.
3.  **Regenerate** bindings by running `bunx tauri dev`.
4.  **Import** from `commands` in your TypeScript file.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>JMSR doesn't appear as cast target</strong></summary>

*   Ensure you're logged in (check Operations Console shows "Connected").
*   Refresh the Jellyfin web page after JMSR connects.
*   Check Jellyfin Dashboard > Activity for the JMSR session.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>MPV doesn't start</strong></summary>

*   Verify MPV is installed: `mpv --version`.
*   Check MPV is in PATH (or set explicit path in Operations Console settings).
*   **Windows (Scoop)**: JMSR auto-resolves symlinks, but ensure the shim is valid.
*   Check Operations Console > Player Bridge settings for detected path.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Video doesn't play</strong></summary>

*   Check Jellyfin transcoding settings.
*   Verify network connectivity to Jellyfin server.
*   Check Diagnostics in the Operations Console for error messages.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Connection lost</strong></summary>

*   JMSR auto-reconnects with exponential backoff (1s → 60s).
*   Check network connectivity.
*   Toast notifications will indicate connection status.
</details>
