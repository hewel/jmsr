# 0005. Adopt headless Ark UI primitives

## Status

Accepted

## Context

JMSR needs accessible, predictable interactive controls for login, settings, diagnostics, dialogs, playback controls, and ordered language preferences. The app already owns a dark Control Room visual system in `src/index.css` and `docs/design-system.md`; replacing it with a styled component kit would blur the product identity and destabilize existing class APIs.

## Decision

Use `@ark-ui/solid` as the headless primitive layer for migrated Solid controls. Ark UI owns state-machine behavior, ARIA wiring, focus management, and `data-scope` / `data-part` styling hooks. JMSR keeps ownership of layout, tokens, Tailwind classes, domain behavior, persistence, and command timing.

TanStack Form remains the value and validation owner for forms. Ark Field only supplies accessible field structure.

## Consequences

- Interactive primitives can be migrated incrementally without importing a generic visual theme.
- Shared CSS targets Ark data attributes while preserving Control Room styling.
- Tests should assert user behavior first, with small data-scope/data-part smoke checks for migrated Ark families.
- Hand-rolled primitives should not be added where an adopted Ark primitive already fits the control semantics.
